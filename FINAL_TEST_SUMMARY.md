- **Success Rate:** 100% (19/19 tests)
- **Error Rate:** 0%
- **Server Stability:** Stable throughout all tests
- **Rate Limiting:** No issues with 1-second delays

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### API Route: `/api/ghl/create-lead`
- **File:** `app/api/ghl/create-lead/route.ts`
- **Key Function:** `createOrUpdateGHLContact()`
- **Custom Fields Logic:** Lines 288-366
- **Array Handling:** Lines 332-366

### Field Mapping Configuration
```javascript
const CUSTOM_FIELD_MAPPING = {
  business_type: 'business_type',
  content_goals: 'content_goals',
  monthly_leads: 'monthly_leads',

### GHL API Format (FIXED)
```javascript
// Correct format (now implemented)
{
  key: 'business_type',
  field_value: 'agency'
}
