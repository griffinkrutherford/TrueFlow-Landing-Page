## Current Field Mapping Status

### ‚úÖ Successfully Mapped Fields (8 fields)

| Form Field | Submitted Value | GHL Field | GHL Field ID | Status |
|------------|----------------|-----------|--------------|--------|
| **businessName** | "All Fields Validation LLC" | Business Name | `lpmpRi1M77nAS6zxTuUr` | ‚úÖ |
| **businessType** | "consulting" | Business Type | `dXKJp1XJuv7jW2JlLp90` | ‚úÖ |
| **contentGoals** | ["newsletters","blogs","social","courses","webinars","podcasts"] | Content Goals | `th0d43amiLOtURkAgDit` | ‚úÖ |
| **selectedPlan** | "enterprise-system" | Selected Plan | `tV6OLe2gYJmnrLqw9cwG` | ‚úÖ |
| **leadScore** | 65 (calculated) | Lead Score | `0HLVAtRKvV9eki6PK17o` | ‚úÖ |

| **submissionDate** | "2025-07-30" (auto) | Submission Date | `8NH3Elaej0wpunZjXXMh` | ‚úÖ |

### ‚ùå Fields NOT Mapped - Available in GHL (Critical Gap)

Based on the GoHighLevel interface and custom fields list, these form questions have corresponding custom fields but are NOT being populated:

| Form Question | Submitted Data | Available GHL Field | GHL Field ID | Expected Mapping |
|---------------|----------------|--------------------|--------------| -----------------|
| **Team Size** | "51-100" | "How many team/staff members do you have?" | `SW74qfoKtVATuI8arKeT` | Should map |
| **Monthly Leads** | "1000+" | "Estimated total number of new leads per month" | `o21JcZLsvRtV1FB8gbcx` | Should map |
| **Current Tools** | ["salesforce","mailchimp","hootsuite","zapier","hubspot"] | "Which of the following do you currently use?" | `qIuaJLoxGAbXLeIQc3Nw` | Should map |
| **Biggest Challenge** | "lead-generation" | "Where are you still experiencing friction?" | `cEI7a3EjazGsLzlgdMiy` | Should map |

### üìã Additional Available Fields Not Used

GoHighLevel has 75 custom fields available, but many Get Started form questions aren't mapped to them:

| Available GHL Field | Field ID | Current Status |
|---------------------|----------|----------------|
| "What are your goals?" | `Brkz04tAudIpTtwlH5I5` | No form mapping |
| "Why are you reaching out?" | `EGrdNGTizO9YtDuMqAlO` | No form mapping |
| "How did you hear about us?" | `IMu5sYdj4QHp47d6xRQL` | No form mapping |
| "Current revenue range?" | `8CNs6Ol3Bwchi8TY0AnC` | No form mapping |
| "What's already working well in your business?" | `8eycyxGF2bDNKomAzOp8` | No form mapping |
| "What type of business do you run?" | `RmMzHUkIJQEUsioCgYmC` | Could map to businessType |

## Root Cause Analysis

### Issue 1: Key Mismatch Problem
The field mapping system expects fields with `trueflow_` prefixes, but many form questions need to map to existing GoHighLevel fields with different key formats.

**From Server Logs:**
```
[TrueFlow Fields] ‚úó Field not found in GHL: trueflow_monthly_leads (for monthlyLeads) 
[TrueFlow Fields] ‚úó Field not found in GHL: trueflow_team_size (for teamSize)
[TrueFlow Fields] ‚úó Field not found in GHL: trueflow_current_tools (for currentTools)
[TrueFlow Fields] ‚úó Field not found in GHL: trueflow_biggest_challenge (for biggestChallenge)
```

**But these fields DO exist in GHL:**
- Monthly Leads ‚Üí Field ID `o21JcZLsvRtV1FB8gbcx` 
- Team Size ‚Üí Field ID `SW74qfoKtVATuI8arKeT`
- Current Tools ‚Üí Field ID `qIuaJLoxGAbXLeIQc3Nw`
- Biggest Challenge ‚Üí Field ID `cEI7a3EjazGsLzlgdMiy`

### Issue 2: Missing Form Fields in Get Started Form
The Get Started form may not be collecting all the data that could be stored in GoHighLevel's available custom fields.

## Field Coverage Analysis

### Current Coverage: 8/75 fields (10.7%)
- **Core Business Info**: ‚úÖ Working (Business Name, Type, Goals, Plan)
- **Lead Intelligence**: ‚úÖ Working (Score, Quality, Form Type, Date)
- **Team & Operations**: ‚ùå Missing (Team Size, Monthly Leads, Tools, Challenges)
- **Business Context**: ‚ùå Missing (Revenue, Goals, Current Systems)

## Recommendations

### Priority 1: Fix Critical Field Mappings
Update the field mapping system to connect form data to existing GHL fields:

```typescript
// Add to TRUEFLOW_FIELD_MAPPING:
'teamSize': 'SW74qfoKtVATuI8arKeT',           // Maps to "How many team/staff members"
'monthlyLeads': 'o21JcZLsvRtV1FB8gbcx',       // Maps to "Estimated total number of new leads"  
'currentTools': 'qIuaJLoxGAbXLeIQc3Nw',       // Maps to "Which of the following do you currently use"
'biggestChallenge': 'cEI7a3EjazGsLzlgdMiy',   // Maps to "Where are you still experiencing friction"
```

### Priority 2: Expand Get Started Form
Consider adding form fields to capture more business intelligence:
- Revenue range
- Business goals  
- Current systems/tools
- Lead sources
- Pain points

### Priority 3: Field Standardization
Decide whether to:
1. **Option A**: Map to existing GHL fields (recommended for immediate use)
2. **Option B**: Create new `trueflow_` prefixed fields for consistency

## Impact Assessment

**Current State**: Only capturing 8 data points from form submissions  
**Potential State**: Could capture 20+ data points with proper field mapping  
**Business Impact**: Missing critical lead qualification data

## Validation Results

‚úÖ **Core Integration Working**: Forms create contacts, apply tags, calculate scores  
‚ùå **Data Capture Incomplete**: Missing 60%+ of potential custom field data  
‚ö†Ô∏è  **Action Required**: Field mapping updates needed for complete data capture

**Overall Status**: Integration functional but significantly underutilizing GoHighLevel's data capture capabilities.
