# Build Fixes Summary - July 29, 2025

## Production Build Errors Fixed

### 1. **Import Error: calculateLeadQualityScore**
**Error**: `'@/lib/ghl/custom-fields' has no exported member named 'calculateLeadQualityScore'`

**Files Fixed**:
- `/app/api/ghl/create-lead-test/route.ts`
- `/app/api/ghl/create-lead/route-custom-fields.ts`

**Fix**: Changed `calculateLeadQualityScore` to `calculateLeadScore` (the correct function name)

### 2. **Import Error: TRUEFLOW_CUSTOM_FIELDS**
**Error**: `'TRUEFLOW_CUSTOM_FIELDS' is not exported from './custom-fields'`

**File Fixed**: `/lib/ghl/api-client.ts`

**Fix**: Changed `TRUEFLOW_CUSTOM_FIELDS` to `customFieldDefinitions` (the correct export name)

### 3. **Type Error in page-fix.tsx**
**Error**: `Cannot find name 'contactInfo'` in `/app/readiness-assessment/page-fix.tsx`

**Fix**: Renamed file from `page-fix.tsx` to `page-fix.txt` to exclude from build (it was a code snippet, not a complete component)

## Build Status

âœ… **Build now completes successfully**

The production build on Railway should now work properly after these fixes are pushed.

## Notes

- The ESLint warning about `@typescript-eslint/recommended` is non-critical and appears to be looking at a parent directory config
- All TypeScript compilation errors have been resolved
- The application builds successfully with all routes properly generated
