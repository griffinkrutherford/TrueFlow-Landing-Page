# TrueFlow AI Security Audit Report

**Date:** January 17, 2025  
**Auditor:** Security Specialist Agent  
**Scope:** TrueFlow AI Landing Page Repository

## Executive Summary

This security audit examined the TrueFlow AI codebase focusing on common web application vulnerabilities. The application demonstrates good security practices overall, with proper environment variable usage and minimal attack surface. However, several security improvements are recommended to enhance the application's security posture.

## Vulnerability Assessment

### 1. Exposed API Keys, Secrets, or Credentials
**Status:** ‚úÖ SECURE  
**Findings:**
- No hardcoded API keys or secrets found in the codebase
- API keys are properly accessed via environment variables (`process.env.RESEND_API_KEY`)
- Example `.env` files are provided without actual credentials
- No actual `.env` files are committed to the repository

**Recommendations:** None - Current implementation follows best practices.

### 2. SQL Injection Vulnerabilities
**Status:** ‚úÖ NOT APPLICABLE  
**Findings:**
- No database connections or SQL queries found in the codebase
- The application appears to be a static landing page with minimal backend functionality
- No ORM or database drivers detected in dependencies

**Recommendations:** None - No database layer present.

### 3. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerabilities
**Status:** ‚úÖ SECURE  
**Findings:**
- No use of `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` or `innerHTML`
- React's default XSS protection is in place
- User input is properly handled through controlled components
- No direct DOM manipulation that could introduce XSS

**Recommendations:** Continue using React's built-in XSS protection.

### 4. Authentication and Authorization
**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è LIMITED IMPLEMENTATION  
**Findings:**
- No authentication system implemented (appropriate for a public landing page)
- The `/api/lead-notification` endpoint has no authentication
- No user sessions or JWT tokens found

**Recommendations:**
- Consider adding rate limiting to the `/api/lead-notification` endpoint
- Implement CAPTCHA or similar anti-bot measures for the lead form

### 5. CORS Configuration and API Security
**Status:** üî¥ NEEDS IMPROVEMENT  
**Findings:**
- CORS is configured with wildcard origin (`Access-Control-Allow-Origin: '*'`)
- This allows any domain to call the API endpoint

**Critical Issue Found:**
```typescript
// Current implementation in /app/api/lead-notification/route.ts
export async function OPTIONS(request: NextRequest) {
  return new NextResponse(null, {
    status: 200,
    headers: {
      'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': '*',  // Security risk!
      'Access-Control-Allow-Methods': 'POST, OPTIONS',
      'Access-Control-Allow-Headers': 'Content-Type',
    },
  })
}
```

### 6. Dependency Security
**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è REVIEW RECOMMENDED  
**Findings:**
- Dependencies appear to be relatively up-to-date
- Next.js 14.1.4 (current, but should be monitored for updates)
- React 18.3.1 (current)
- No known critical vulnerabilities in listed dependencies

**Recommendations:**
- Run `npm audit` regularly
- Set up automated dependency updates with Dependabot
- Consider using `npm audit fix` to address any vulnerabilities

### 7. File Upload Security
**Status:** ‚úÖ NOT APPLICABLE  
**Findings:**
- No file upload functionality detected in the codebase
- No multipart form handling or file processing logic

**Recommendations:** None - No file upload functionality present.

### 8. Additional Security Concerns

#### A. Information Disclosure
**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è MINOR ISSUE  
**Findings:**
- Error responses include detailed error messages that could aid attackers
- API responses include debug information in error cases

#### B. Input Validation
**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è NEEDS IMPROVEMENT  
**Findings:**
- Basic validation exists for required fields
- No email format validation
- No input sanitization for stored data

#### C. Rate Limiting
**Status:** üî¥ NOT IMPLEMENTED  
**Findings:**
- No rate limiting on the `/api/lead-notification` endpoint
- Potential for abuse through spam submissions

## Security Fixes Implementation

I've created an enhanced, secure version of the lead notification API endpoint. The improvements include:

### Fix 1: Secure CORS Configuration
‚úÖ **Implemented** - Created `/app/api/lead-notification/route-secure.ts`

The new CORS configuration:
- Removes wildcard origin (`*`)
- Implements an allowlist of trusted domains
- Only allows specific origins to access the API

### Fix 2: Rate Limiting
‚úÖ **Implemented** - Added to secure route file

Rate limiting features:
- 5 requests per minute per IP address
- In-memory storage (suitable for single-instance deployments)
- Returns 429 status code when limit exceeded
- For production, consider using Redis for distributed rate limiting

### Fix 3: Input Validation and Sanitization
‚úÖ **Implemented** - Added to secure route file

Security improvements:
- Email format validation using regex
- Input sanitization to prevent XSS attacks
- Removes potentially dangerous characters from user input

### Fix 4: Error Message Security
‚úÖ **Implemented** - Added to secure route file

Improvements:
- Generic error messages to prevent information disclosure
- No debug information exposed in production
- Consistent error responses

## Implementation Instructions

To apply these security fixes:

1. **Replace the existing route file** with the secure version:
   ```bash
   mv app/api/lead-notification/route-secure.ts app/api/lead-notification/route.ts
   ```

2. **For production deployment**, consider:
   - Using Redis for distributed rate limiting
   - Implementing CAPTCHA for the lead form
   - Adding request signing or API tokens
   - Setting up a WAF (Web Application Firewall)

3. **Environment-specific CORS origins**:
   - Update the `allowedOrigins` array based on your deployment environments
   - Remove localhost origins for production builds

## Additional Security Recommendations

### 1. Content Security Policy (CSP)
Add CSP headers to prevent XSS attacks. In your Next.js configuration:

```javascript
// next.config.js
module.exports = {
  async headers() {
    return [
      {
        source: '/:path*',
        headers: [
          {
            key: 'Content-Security-Policy',
            value: "default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline';"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### 2. Security Headers
Add additional security headers:

```javascript
headers: [
  { key: 'X-Frame-Options', value: 'DENY' },
  { key: 'X-Content-Type-Options', value: 'nosniff' },
  { key: 'Referrer-Policy', value: 'strict-origin-when-cross-origin' },
  { key: 'Permissions-Policy', value: 'camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=()' }
]
```

### 3. API Token Authentication
For additional security, implement API token authentication:

```typescript
const API_TOKEN = process.env.API_TOKEN

if (request.headers.get('x-api-token') !== API_TOKEN) {
  return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Unauthorized' }, { status: 401 })
}
```

### 4. Monitoring and Logging
Implement security monitoring:
- Log all API requests with timestamps
- Monitor for suspicious patterns
- Set up alerts for multiple failed requests
- Track rate limit violations

### 5. Regular Security Updates
- Enable Dependabot for automated dependency updates
- Run `npm audit` before each deployment
- Subscribe to security advisories for your dependencies
- Perform quarterly security reviews

## Compliance Considerations

The application should consider:
- **GDPR Compliance**: Add privacy policy and data handling procedures
- **CCPA Compliance**: Implement data deletion requests
- **Email Compliance**: Ensure CAN-SPAM Act compliance for email communications

## Summary

The TrueFlow AI landing page demonstrates good baseline security practices. The implemented fixes address the critical issues found during the audit. With the recommended additional security measures, the application will have a robust security posture suitable for production deployment.
